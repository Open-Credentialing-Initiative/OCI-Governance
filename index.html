    <h2>Incubators within the Center for Supply Chain Studies</h2>
    <p> The Center for Supply Chain Studies hosts and facilitates industry-wide Studies as a way to openly exchange ideas, share expertise and explore the complex regulatory and operational operations issues facing today’s supply chain. Additionally, the Center offers Incubator support with a structure similar to its industry-wide Studies to groups of collaborating companies that are in the early process of implementing industry benefiting processes, technologies, and initiatives.  The purpose of an Incubator project is to provide enough support to allow the Incubator Members to launch an initiative into a more formal structure or find homes for the initiative’s artifacts, activities, and discussions.</p> 

<p>Incubator sponsors and participants are able to remove administrative burdens by leveraging the Center’s resources – freeing them to pursue the explorative goals that brought them together in the first place. All industry-wide Studies, Private Studies and Incubators are conducted in a manner that adheres to current anti-trust laws and provide an educational environment for the benefit of the industry at large.</p>

<h2>Incubator Charter</h2>
<p>This “Incubator Charter” establishes the terms under which this project will operate as an Incubator of the Center for Supply Chain Studies (the “Center”). The Center provides resources for the duration of the project as well as confirming that Incubator Participants conduct their activities in accordance with the Center’s corporate purpose and policies, such as its non-profit status, accounting, and regulatory guidelines. Incubators are otherwise independent. This Incubator Charter and attached Membership Agreement is entered into and made effective as of March 1, 2021 (“Effective Date”), among the parties listed in Attachment 1 to the Membership Agreement and any third party that executes this Incubator Charter and Membership Agreement after the Effective Date.</p>

<h3>Incubator Initiation.</h3>
<p>The Incubator will become effective upon execution of a Membership Agreement for this Incubator by 2 Steering Members. New parties may join the Incubator upon Approval of the Steering Members.</p>
<h3>Membership Levels.</h3>
<p>Each Incubator Member company must assign a Steering Member from the organization that will participate on the Steering Committee.  All other Members from a Member company can participate as an Associate and Contributor.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Steering Member. Steering Members may participate in each Working Group and, unless waived per the Membership Agreement, the Steering Committee.</li>
<li>Associate. Associates may participate in each Working Group, but do not participate on the Steering Committee.</li>
<li>Contributor. Contributors may participate in each Working Group, but do not participate on the Steering Committee and are not eligible to participate in decisions that require a Supermajority Vote. </li>
  </ul>
<h3>Organization.</h3>
  <ul>
<li>Steering Committee. The Steering Committee is the body that is responsible for governing the Incubator, identifying new Working Groups, tracking Working Group progress, ensuring Working Group meet their goals, etc.</li>
<li>Advisors to OCI.  The Advisor Committee is made up of outside subject matter experts and is appointed by the Steering Committee for a period set by the Steering Committee. </li>
<li>Facilitator. The Incubator will have a Facilitator whose responsibilities are set forth in the Series Agreement and will include organizing meetings, organizing voting, and any other activities Approved by the Steering Members. </li>
  </ul>
<h3>Decision-making.</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Consensus/Voting/Approval. The Steering Committee and each Working Group will endeavor to make all decisions by consensus. Where the Steering Committee or Working Group cannot reach consensus with respect to a particular decision, the Steering Committee or Working Group will make that decision by a Supermajority Vote of the Steering Members or Working Group Participants, as applicable.</li>
    <li>Notifications and Electronic Voting. The Facilitator is responsible for issuing all notifications of meetings and votes of the Steering Members and each Working Group chair is responsible for issuing all notifications of meetings and votes of the Working Group for which it is the chair, in each case subject to the following minimum criteria: (i) in-person meetings require at least 30 days prior written notice, (ii) teleconference meetings require at least 2 days prior written notice (this requirement only applies to the notification of the first meeting of automatically recurring teleconference meetings), (iii) electronic votes require no advance notice but must be made pursuant to a clear and unambiguous ballot with only “yes” and “no” options, and the voting must remain open for no less than 7 days. These notification requirements with respect to the Incubator or that particular Working Group may be overridden upon unanimous consent of all Steering Members or all applicable Working Group Participants that have attended and participated in at least 50% of the last 4 meetings of the Incubator or Particular Working Group.</li>
   </ul>
<h3>Working Groups.</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Working Groups. The Incubator may have multiple Working Groups, and each Working Group will operate as set forth in this Section and its Working Group Charter.</li>
    <li>Working Group Chair. Each Working Group will designate a chair for that Working Group. A Working Group may select a new chair upon Approval of the Working Group Participants.</li>
    <li>Working Group Requirements. Each Working Group must be comprised of at least 2 Working Group Participants. No Working Group Participant will be permitted to participate in a Working Group without first Joining the Working Group.</li>
  </ul>
<h3> Conditions for Contributions.</h3>
<p> A Steering Member, Associate, or Contributor may not make any Contribution unless that Steering Member, Associate or Contributor is the exclusive intellectual property owner of the Contribution or has sufficient intellectual property rights from the copyright owners to make the Contribution under the terms of this Incubator Charter and applicable Working Group Charter. The Steering Member, Associate, or Contributor must disclose the identities of all known copyright owners in theContribution. With regard to all intellectual property (including without limitation patents, copyrights, and trade secrets) owned by, or licensed to, a party prior to the date of this Incubator Charter, or created by a party during the term of this Incubator Charter, and to the extent such intellectual property is contributed, disclosed, or shared under this Incubator Charter or the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, such party shall continue to own such intellectual property. Additionally, such party grants the recipients of such intellectual property a perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable, worldwide license to use such intellectual property solely to develop, use, support and provide the business interaction network, acknowledging that it is the intent of the parties that the business interaction network and the underlying collaboration will be handled under a written agreement to be executed in the future.</p>
<h3>Deliverable Development Process.</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Pre-Draft. Any Working Group Participant or Contributor may submit a proposed initial draft document as a candidate Draft Deliverable of that Working Group. The Working Group chair will designate each submission as a “Pre-Draft” document.</li>
    <li>Draft. Each Pre-Draft document of a Working Group must first be Approved by the Working Group Participants of that Working Group to become a Draft Deliverable. Once the Working Group approves a document as a Draft Deliverable, the Draft Deliverable becomes the basis for all going forward work on that deliverable.</li>
    <li>Working Group Approval. Once a Working Group believes it has achieved the objectives for its deliverable as described in the Scope, it will progress its Draft Deliverable to “Working Group Approved” status.</li>
    <li>Final Approval. Upon a Draft Deliverable reaching Working Group Approved status, the Facilitator or his/her designee will present that Working Group Approved Draft Deliverable to all Steering Members for Approval. Upon Approval by the Steering Members, that Draft Deliverable will be designated an “Approved Deliverable.”</li>
    <li>Publication and Submission. Upon the designation of a Draft Deliverable as an Approved Deliverable, the Facilitator will publish the Approved Deliverable in a manner agreed upon by the Working Group Participants (i.e., Incubator Participant only location, publicly available location, Incubator maintained website, Incubator member website, etc.), subject to the prior written consent of the Steering Member signing this Incubator Charter. The publication of an Approved Deliverable in a publicly accessible manner must include an appropriate reference to the Apache 2.0 Licenseterms under which the Approved Deliverable and/or source code is being made available under, as set forth in the applicable Working Group Charter.</li>
    <li>Submissions to Standards Bodies. No Draft Deliverable or Approved Deliverable may be submitted to a standards development organization without Approval by the Steering Members, and subject to the prior written consent of the Steering Member signing this Incubator Charter. Upon Approval by the Steering Members, the Facilitator will coordinate the submission of the applicable Draft Deliverable or Approved Deliverable to a standards development organization with Center for Supply Chain Studies. Working Group Participants that developed that Draft Deliverable or Approved Deliverable agree to grant the copyright rights necessary to make those submissions. </li>
  </ul> 
<h3>Withdrawal and Termination.</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Term. The term of this agreement is 1 year from the date this agreement is countersigned by the Incubator Members. </li>
    <li>Withdrawal or Termination. A Steering Member, Associate, or Contributor may withdraw from a Working Group or the Incubator at any time by notifying the Facilitator in writing, and that withdrawal is effective upon receipt of the notice. Upon a Supermajority Vote of all Steering Members (calculated without the vote of the Steering Member in question), a Steering Member, Associate, or Contributor may be terminated from the Incubator or withdrawn from a Working Group.</li>
    <li>Incubator Termination. Upon a Supermajority Vote of the Steering Members, the Incubator will cease and terminate as of the effective date designated in that vote. The Facilitator will coordinate with the Center to facilitate that termination.</li>
    <li>Effect of Withdrawal or Termination. Upon a Steering Member’s, Associate’s, or Contributor’s written withdrawal from a Working Group or upon the termination of its Incubator membership, all existing commitments, and obligations with respect to the Incubator or Working Group, as the case may be, up to the effective date of withdrawal or termination will remain in effect, but no new obligations will be incurred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the license granted in Section 6 shall survive any withdrawal, termination, or expiration of this Incubator Agreement. </li>
  </ul>
