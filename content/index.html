      <p>This is a living OCI Document developed by OCI Members with input
        from relevant interested parties. It is anticipated that the contents of this document will be reviewed and
        updated to address any applicable feedback. A list of current public OCI Documents, including Conformance Criteria, can

      <h2>Purpose</h2>
          <p>The Open Credentialing Initivative (OCI) was started as an Incubator of the Center for Supply Chain Studies. 
            This document is based on the original Charter with necessary additions relating to governance details not 
            previously recorded.<br><br>
            OCI is an open source initiative. All artifacts created by OCI are governed under the 
            <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache 2.0 license</a> (collaborative, open source 
            software development).<br> <br>
            As OCI artifacts are used by US pharmaceutical trading partners to comply with the Drug Supply Chain Security Act 
            (DSCSA), other laws, regulations and industry consensus agreements and international standards, it is imperative 
            that the OCI architecture design and maintenance is guided by industry participants (trading partners), regulators 
            and stakeholders.<br> <br>
            Hence, OCI encourages contributions from OCI member and non-member companies and individuals by following the 
            processes described in this document. In particular, contributors should note the applicable license and required 
            contributor assertions.</p>

  <!-- Charter History -->
  <section>
      <h2>Incubator within the Center for Supply Chain Studies</h2>
          <p> The Center for Supply Chain Studies hosts and facilitates industry-wide Studies as a way to openly exchange ideas, share expertise and explore the complex regulatory and operational issues facing today’s supply chain. Additionally, the Center offers Incubator support with a structure similar to its industry-wide Studies to groups of collaborating companies that are in the early process of implementing industry benefiting processes, technologies, and initiatives. The purpose of an Incubator project is to provide enough support to allow the Incubator Members to launch an initiative into a more formal structure or establish relationships with other organizations to transfer the initiative’s artifacts, activities, and discussions.</p> 
          <p>Incubator sponsors and participants are able to remove administrative burdens by leveraging the Center’s resources – freeing them to pursue the explorative goals that brought them together in the first place. All members will conduct industry-wide studies, private studies, and other Incubator work in accordance and in compliance with all applicable anti-trust laws and provide an educational environment for the benefit of the industry at large.</p>
            <h3>Incubator Charter</h3>
                <p>The original “<a>Incubator Charter</a>” established the intial terms under which this project operates as an Incubator of the Center for Supply Chain Studies (the “Center”). The Center provides resources for the duration of the project as well as confirming that Incubator Participants conduct their activities in accordance with the Center’s corporate purpose and policies, such as its non-profit status, accounting, and regulatory guidelines. Incubators are otherwise independent. The Incubator Charter was entered into and made effective as of March 1, 2021 (“Effective Date”).</p>

    <h2>Trusted Issuer Registry Governance</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>OCI maintains a <a>Trusted Issuer Registry</a>. To this end, it employs an Ethereum <a>smart contract</a> managed by so-called <a>Statekeepers</a>. They execute the Steering Committee’s decisions concerning the Trusted Issuer Registry and report to the Steering Committee.</p>
        <figure id="figure">
          <img src="assets/OCI-issuer-registry-governance.svg" alt="OCI trusted issuer registry governance overview" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;" />
          <figcaption>OCI Trusted Issuer Registry Governance</figcaption>
        </figure>
      <h3>Steering Committee Oversight</h3>
          <p>
            The Steering Committee SHALL be accountable and responsible for the <a>Trusted Issuer Registry</a> management. The voting on decisions concerning the Trusted Issuer Registry SHALL follow OCI’s Governance section <a href="#decision-making">Decision Making</a>.<br> <br> 
            Following a decision, the Steering Committee SHALL request from the Trusted Issuer Registry <a>Statekeepers</a> to update the Trusted Issuer Registry.<br> <br>
            The initial Statekeepers SHALL be assigned by the Steering Committee following the afore-mentioned OCI decision-making process. Any subsequent changes to the initial list of Statekeepers SHALL follow the process described in this chapter. <br> <br>
          </p>
      <h3>Trusted Issuer Registry Statekeeper</h3>
          <p>
            Statekeepers are OCI member organizations responsible for maintaining and updating the <a>Trusted Issuer Registry</a> on behalf of the Steering Committee. Statekeepers SHALL amend the Trusted Issuer Registry only upon approval by the Steering Committee. Statekeepers report to the Steering Committee.<br><br>
            Each Statekeeper SHALL have the permission and technical capability to sign Trusted Issuer Registry transactions. By signing, the Statekeeper exerts their <a>voting</a> power. Only when a transaction is signed in accordance with the respective governance parameters, will the <a>smart contract</a> be updated.<br><br>
            Each Statekeeper SHALL procure and employ a hardware wallet for storing and managing the Ethereum wallet that facilitates the Trusted Issuer Registry management. Statekeepers SHALL use the OCI-provided <a href="https://open-credentialing-initiative.github.io/trusted-issuer-frontend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dApp</a> to manage the Trusted Issuer Registry.<br><br>
            The executing Statekeeper MAY be a single assigned individual within the OCI member organization or represented by a multi-signature wallet. The latter is effectively a shared account, which can be managed by multiple individuals within the organization. Each Statekeeper has only 1 organizational vote regardless of the number of representing individuals.<br><br>
          </p>
      <h3>Trusted Issuer Registry Parameters</h3>
          <p>The scope of registry management and corresponding <a>voting</a> thresholds are as follows:</p>
            <table class="simple">
              <tr>
                <th><b>Registry Management</b></th>
                <th><b>Voting</b></th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Add a new Statekeeper to the Trusted Issuer Registry smart contract</td>
                <td>at least 60% of all Statekeepers SHALL vote in favor</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Remove a Statekeeper from the Trusted Issuer Registry smart contract</td>
                <td>at least 60% of all Statekeepers SHALL vote in favor</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Add a Trusted Issuer to the Trusted Issuer Registry (see Note 1)</td>
                <td>at least 60% of all Statekeepers SHALL vote in favor</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Remove a Trusted Issuer from the Trusted Issuer Registry (see Note 1)</td>
                <td>at least 60% of all Statekeepers SHALL vote in favor</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Change a governance parameter concerning the Trusted Issuer Registry</td>
                <td>at least 60% of all Statekeepers SHALL vote in favor</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Retire the Trusted Issuer Registry smart contract</td>
                <td>at least 60% of all Statekeepers SHALL vote in favor</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p><b>Note 1</b><br>
              The <a>Trusted Issuer Registry</a> captures Credential Issuers in the form of their unique identifier (DID). A Credential Issuer MAY be associated with more than one DID. However, a single DID SHALL only ever be associated with one Credential Issuer. As far as Trusted Issuer Registry management is concerned, each DID is regarded as a single Credential Issuer. Thus, the addition or removal of each DID SHALL be subject to approval by the Steering Committee.

          <h3>OCI Architecture Contribution and Change Process</h3>
              <p>The <strong>OCI Steering Committee</strong> has approved authors (Document Authors, Code Authors, etc.) within the <strong>OCI Policy and Architecture Committee</strong> who are responsible for managing <a>Contributions</a> and communicating with <a>contributors</a>. The Policy and Architecture Committee has a process to vet document and code changes resulting from <a>Contributions</a> against requirements provided by industry trading partners and other stakeholders.</p>

              <ol>
                <li>A <a>Contribution</a> or Change Request SHALL be submitted via the afore-mentioned dedicated communication paths provided by OCI.</li>
                <li>The Policy and Architecture (P&A) Committee performs a detailed assessment and impact analysis to derive an initial decision about the validity and extent of the proposal. Where further consultations with other organizations or experts are required, these will be carried out as appropriate. The Policy and Architecture Committee also keeps the Steering Committee informed regularly about received change requests and their evaluation.</li>       
                <li>If the proposal is <b>not</b> deemed worthy of any further consideration, the Policy and Architecture Committee will inform the <a>Contributor</a>.</li>
                <li>Should the Policy and Architecture Committee approve the change request and it does <b>not</b> constitute a substantive change to existing OCI rules or requirements, it will be scheduled for implementation. The result will be published and the <a>Contributor</a> informed.</li>
                <li>Should the Policy and Architecture Committee approve the change request and it constitutes a <b>substantive change</b> to existing OCI rules or requirements, it will be proposed to the Steering Committee.</li>
                <li>The Steering Committee assesses whether further consultations with industry professionals are needed to ensure alignment with industry needs.</li>
                <li>If the Steering Committee does <b>not</b> see any need for further enquiry with industry professionals, the proposal will not be taken to an <a>Industry Alignment Session</a>. The Steering Committee will decide whether to approve the Request. If it is rejected, the <a>Contributor</a> will be informed by the Steering Committee. If the change request is approved, it will be scheduled for implementation. The result will be published and the <a>Contributor</a> informed.</li>
                <li>If the Steering Committee deems it necessary to enquire with industry professionals, the change request will be proposed at the next possible <a>Industry Alignment Session</a>. The <a>Contributor</a> may participate at this open meeting. If the group present at that meeting deems it necessary to perform further detailed impact analysis on behalf of the industry, a special <a>Industry Alignment Session</a> will be scheduled to focus on the change request. The <a>Contributor</a> may also participate at this discussion.</li>
                <li>If the change request obtains <b>final approval</b> by the Steering Committee after the held <a>Industry Alignment Session</a>, it will be scheduled for implementation. The result will be published and the <a>Contributor</a> informed.</li>
                <li>If the change request does <b>not</b> obtain final approval after the held <a>Industry Alignment Session</a>, it will be rejected and the <a>Contributor</a> informed by the Steering Committee.</li>
                <li>The <a>Contributor</a> may then launch the <em>OCI Architecture Appeal Process</em> described in the following Section to justify their re-submission of the proposal for further consideration.</li>
              </ol>  
                <p> Changes to OCI documents and code are bundled together into <strong>interoperability profiles</strong> that define the document and code sets that must be implemented together to maintain interoperability across the industry. OCI, through the Policy and Architecture Committee and approved by the Steering Committee, will maintain an industry implementation roadmap including sunrise and sunset dates for interoperability profile versions.

          <h3>OCI Architecture Appeal Process</h3>
              <p>It may be the case that a particular <a>Contribution</a> is rejected by the OCI committees. OCI has instituted this appeal process to allow the <a>contributor</a> to defend their case.</p>

                <li>The <a>Contributor</a> SHALL use the afore-mentioned dedicated communication paths for <a>Contribution</a> to launch the <em>OCI Architecture Appeal Process</em>. This will require a justification for the re-submission.</li>
                <li>The Policy & Architecture (P&A) and Steering Committees will evaluate the justification for the appeal, including any newly provided information. If the justification raises arguments that convince <b>both</b> committees to re-consider the proposal, they will engage in activities to consider the new information and determine how to handle the proposal. This may involve the examination of modifications or alternatives.</li>
                <li>The Steering Committee assesses whether further consultations with industry professionals are needed to ensure alignment with industry needs.</li>
                <li>If the Steering Committee does <b>not</b> see any need for further enquiry with industry professionals, the proposal will not be taken to an <a>Industry Alignment Session</a>. The Steering Committee will decide whether to approve the appeal. If it is rejected, the <a>Contributor</a> will be informed by the Steering Committee. If the appeal is approved, it will be subjected to the <em>OCI Architecture Contribution and Change Process</em> described in the previous Section.</li>
                <li>If the Steering Committee deems it necessary to enquire with industry professionals, the appeal will be proposed at the next possible <a>Industry Alignment Session</a>. The <a>Contributor</a> may participate at this open meeting. If the group present at that meeting deems it necessary to perform further detailed impact analysis on behalf of the industry, a special <a>Industry Alignment Session</a> will be scheduled to focus on the appeal. The <a>Contributor</a> may also participate at this discussion.</li>
                <li>If the appeal obtains <b>final approval</b> by the Steering Committee after the held <a>Industry Alignment Session</a>, it will be subjected to the <em>OCI Architecture Contribution and Change Process</em> described in the previous Section.</li>
                <li>If the appeal does <b>not</b> obtain final approval after the held <a>Industry Alignment Session</a>, it will be rejected and the <a>Contributor</a> informed by the Steering Committee.</li>
                <li>The <a>Contributor</a> <em>MAY NOT</em> open another appeal process on the same proposal. Any such attempt will be disregarded.</li>
                <li>If the appeal process reveals suggestions for improvement that the <a>Contributor</a> is willing to accept, they are encouraged to submit an amended proposal by starting a new request for change process.</li>
              </ol>
        
          <h3>Submissions to Standards Bodies</h3> 
              <p>No OCI <a>Deliverable</a> may be submitted to a standards development organization without approval by the Steering Members. Upon approval by the Steering Members, the Facilitator will coordinate the submission of the applicable <a>Deliverable</a> to a standards development organization with Center for Supply Chain Studies. Working Group Participants that developed that Deliverable agree to grant the copyright rights necessary to make those submissions. </p>
